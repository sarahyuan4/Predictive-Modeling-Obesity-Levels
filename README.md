# Predictive Modeling of Obesity Levels

This project focuses on building **machine learning models** to predict obesity levels in individuals based on their **lifestyle, eating habits, and physical conditions**.

It demonstrates the full end-to-end process — from **data preprocessing** and **EDA** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **visualization** — using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Features

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — visualizes distributions and correlations.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing — handles missing values, encodes categories, and normalizes features.

🤖 Model Training — uses multiple algorithms:

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting / HistGradientBoosting

Logistic Regression

📈 Evaluation Metrics — accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

🔎 Feature Importance — identifies key predictors of obesity level.
